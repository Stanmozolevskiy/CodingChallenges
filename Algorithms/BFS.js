// If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// Breath First Search/Treversal, because you dont have to go to the bottom of the list and can chech close to root

// If the tree of graph is very deep and solutions are rare:
// Breath First Search/Treversal, because the deep tree can take a really long time to do the DFS. Also depends if we care of memory consumption

// If the tree is very wide:
// Depth for search is better because it will use much less memory than BFS.

// If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// Depth for search because the solutions are located deep in the tree, so we have to visit the deep

// Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// That is what the DFS is build for

// Finding the shortes path:
// Breath First Search/Treversal, because you don't have to go deep on each node
